# NitroGen
Discord Nitro Generator (Its open source I promise I'm not spoon feeding you a virus or sending working codes to my server)

# If your going to use the raw files
A module was used in this script that does not come with python. In order to use this script, you need to install the module requests. To do that, open a command prompt and type "pip install requests" without quotation marks.

# How to use?
Go into the python file and near the top you will see a spot to put in a webhook link, put in your webhook link and run the script and it will start generating random codes and if one is valid it will be sent to your webhook.

# How do I get a webhook link?
Here is a useful tutorial. https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks (I DIDN'T READ IT BUT THE PICTURES ARE VERY USEFUL SO IM PUTTING IT HERE)

# Why?
The chances are like one in a quintillion anyways who cares if you leave this running in hopes you successfully get free nitro?
