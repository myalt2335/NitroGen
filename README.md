# NitroGen
Discord Nitro Generator (Its open source I promise I'm not spoon feeding you a virus or sending working codes to my server))
# How to use?
Go into the python file and near the top you will see a spot to put in a webhook link, put in your webhook link and run the script and it will start generating random codes and if one is valid it will be sent to your webhook.
# Why?
The chances are like one in a quintillion anyways who cares if you leave this running in hopes you successfully get free nitro?
