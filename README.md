# NitroGen
Discord Nitro Generator (Its open source I promise I'm not spoon feeding you a virus or sending working codes to my server)

# If your going to use the raw files
A module was used in this script that does not come with python. In order to use this script, you need to install the module requests. To do that, open a command prompt and type "pip install requests" without quotation marks.

# How to use?
Go into the python file and near the top you will see a spot to put in a webhook link, put in your webhook link and run the script and it will start generating random codes and if one is valid it will be sent to your webhook.

# How do I get a webhook link?
Here is a useful tutorial. https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks (I DIDN'T READ IT BUT THE PICTURES ARE VERY USEFUL SO IM PUTTING IT HERE)

# Why?
The chances are like one in a quintillion anyways who cares if you leave this running in hopes you successfully get free nitro?

# Why is it so slow?
I didn't fine tune how long it sleeps between each request yet so in order to not overload the API I added a wait I knew would be long enough to be safe. Maybe a new entry in the V2.1.X series will fine tune how long the script sleeps.

Oh also it skips all of V1 because all of V1 is in development purgatory for being hot garbage. My first working version of the script was V2.1.0 which I replaced with V2.1.2 before I got the idea to make a github page. I then updated to V2.1.3 before I attempted to make a release.
