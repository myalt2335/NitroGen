# NitroGen
Discord Nitro Generator - An open-source tool designed for educational purposes. This project is committed to transparency and ensuring users that it does not distribute viruses or send working codes to external servers.

# Prerequisites for using the source code
Before using the script, make sure to install the required Python module by executing the following command in your terminal:
pip install requests

# How to Use
Run the script.
Paste your Discord webhook URL.
Press Enter, and the script will automatically send any valid codes to the webhook.

# Obtaining a Webhook URL
If you don't have a webhook URL, follow this useful tutorial. Even though I haven't read it, the provided pictures seem helpful.

# Purpose
The probability of success is extremely low, so why not leave this running in the background and see if you get lucky with free Nitro?

# Performance
The script may seem slow because the sleep duration between requests is not fine-tuned. To prevent API overload, a safe wait time has been added. Future updates in the V2.1.X series might optimize this aspect.

Note: V1 has been skipped as it was considered inadequate. The first working version was V2.1.0, later replaced by V2.1.1 and V2.1.2. The GitHub release is based on V2.1.2, serving as the first official release version.
