Im out of ideas for this script past adding more useless features to make it nice and fancy
A lot of V2.1.X features were just helpful for development for me I can get rid of them
Skip V2.X.X past V2.1.X and go straight to V3
V3 could be a final release where all that dev info is just removed so its nice and simple for the user ~~with stuff to make the script run faster without ratelimiting~~
